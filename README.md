## Welcome to my GitHub! ðŸ‘‹

I'm an Accountant turned Software Engineer. I graduated from the Software Engineering Immersive program at General Assembly, where I refined my skills as a full-stack developer. I am eager to find my place on a collaborative team of talented individuals where I can continue expanding my knowledge and developing new skills. I have an eye for detail and love to develop and design. Being able to combine logic and creativity to create applications and solve problems is fun!<br>

When I am not coding, I spend my time playing with my dog, playing video games, watching anime, and baking.
